# ðŸ“„ Profile Server

A simple profile server supporting modified response header (non production) 

## Motivation

I need to serve a file with some additioinal http response header field needed to be evaluated from command line utilities. 

Since Nginx seems to be not capable of it, I wrote this simple server instead.

## Features

- Send a file when accessed via the specified route path
- The above file will be sent with a modified header, including additional fields:

    - `subscription-userinfo`

        e.g., 

        ```
        subscription-userinfo: upload=455727941; download=6174315083; total=1073741824000; expire=1671815872
        ```

    - `profile-update-interval`

        e.g.,

        ```
        profile-update-interval: 12
        ```
    
    - `content-disposition`

        e.g.,

        ```
        attachment; filename*=UTF-8''profile_name
        ```

        > the profile name supports UTF-8, which means it can even contain emoji

    - `profile-web-page-url`

## Installation

Clone this repo and install the required libraries:

```shell
pip install flask

Make sure you have `vnstat` installed to get the traffic data, for instance Debian:

```shell
sudo apt install vnstat
```

## Usage

```shell
python3 main.py --help
```

minimal example:
